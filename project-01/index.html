         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Hi I am Abraham, a 25 year old guy, who has a passion for computers, gaming, and overcoming
            difficult situations. I was born and raised in Greeley, Colorado, I lived there for 16 years 
            and I am currently living in Hobbs, New Mexico. I like to be working at all times, I want to 
            be able to keep my mind occupied and busy. Some of the hobbies I like to do is go workout at 
            the gym 5-6 times a week, going to the gym is something I enjoy very much. I also like to play 
            games in my free time, I think they are fun to play and it takes my mind off things. I hope to 
            have a career in the computer world, technology, or in video game design.
         </p>

                    Shadow The Hedgehog is one of my favorite games that I have played. This game was released in 2005 for the
                    PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. It is a spinoff of the Sonic The Hedgehog series, where Shadow is the
                    main character in this game. I like this game a lot because this game allowed Shadow to use a gun and drive
                    his iconic motorcycle. This game combined 3D fast-paced platforming while using third person shooter elements.
                    I found it very cool as a kid to play as Shadow while holding a gun going through obstacles, I also liked how
                    this game had a more serious and darker tone, with mild language, and slightly more violence than previous Sonic
                    games. It was also the first Sonic Game to ever allow a character to use guns in a game, which I found pretty cool.
                    I own this game on the Playstation, and thats why it is one of my favorite video games.

                    Fortnite is a very fun game for me to play. It is one of my favorite video games that I 
                    have played. I really enjoy Fortnite, mostly for it's battle royale mode, I like the idea 
                    of going against 100 other players and fight each other until the last person standing 
                    wins. I love this game because I get to face other people and even get to meet and make 
                    new friends. Fortnite allows me to interact with others through it's battle royale and 
                    other modes since it is now trying to expand into its own metaverse. The new content and 
                    collaborations of other IP characters has made it into one of my favorite video games. I 
                    have over 2000 hours played on this game. The image is a screenshot of mine from my PS5 
                    where my character or skin is inside a building during a match, I was hiding in the restroom 
                    where I notice a yellow rubber duck in the urinal stall of that match. I found this very 
                    funny to see, since Epic Games likes to do things like this to the player base.

                    Forza Horizon 5 is also part of my collection for my favorite video games. 
                    I enjoy playing this game because Forza Horizon 5 is a open racing game that 
                    takes place in a fictionalized Mexico. My parents are from Mexico, so having 
                    this game take place in Mexico is one reason why I love this game a lot. I 
                    have this game on my Xbox Series X, and on PS5. I also love how there is so 
                    many cars to drive from such as trucks, sports cars, and even old school cars. 
                    It has amazing driving physics, dymanic seasons, and very good customization
                    options. There is about 900 vechicles in this game which is why I have this game 
                    as one of favorite games, because it has a lot of content to choose from.

                    Horizon Forbidden West is included in my collection of my favorite video 
                    games. I like to play this game because I get to fight robotic animal machines and 
                    human ememies in a open world with vast environments that takes place in the year 3000
                    hundreds of years after the humans were wiped out by their own machines they created. The game 
                    centers around Aloy as the main protagonist. This game is very special for me because the story
                    and characters of the single player game creates a very emotional connection. The main character
                    Aloy of her courage and learning how to become herself, really inspired me to face diffcult 
                    challenges in my personal life. This game in a way has pushed me to do better in life and that 
                    is why I have it in my collection of my favorite video games. The screenshot I provided is me 
                    playing as Aloy fighting a giant machine known as a Tideripper.

                <p class="description">
                    I like this game because it is also a racing game and it involves Sonic characters 
                    such as Sonic, Shadow, and Silver the Hedgehog. I like the racing mechanics in this
                    game, I like how on the first lap, you race in one world, and then in the second lap, 
                    you are racing on a completely different world by going through a ring portal, then 
                    on the final lap you are back to the first world on lap 1. I like this feature for 
                    Sonic Racing Crossworlds because this changes your strategies and predictability for 
                    races, because it makes you prepare for any possible outcome especially in online 
                    matches where it can get so chaotic, this aspect makes the game very fun for me to 
                    enjoy because it adds challenge and tough competition. This game is part of my collection 
                    because of the insane amount of vehicle cusotmization it contains and the huge roster 
                    of playable characters it provides.

                <p class="description">
                    Need For Speed Heat is also part of my collection of my favorite video games. 
                    I like this game a lot because I was to play in illegal street races to earn 
                    REP or reputation. I like how I was able to race other players and outrun a rouge 
                    police task force that would chase you. My favorite part of this game is whenever 
                    I played the night section of the game being chased by the cop cars throughout the 
                    city, reaching a heat level 5 in the night time mode made so chaotic and fun, because 
                    it was very hard for me to outrun the fast police cars in the game. This game is also 
                    special for me because the amount of cars it has. I am a big fan of all types of cars, 
                    so having lots of cars in the game makes me happy.
